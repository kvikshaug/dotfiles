This folder handles the info in the dwm status bar.

Two eternally looped processes are started in .xinitrc.
One runs the sb file pretty often, something like every 5 seconds.
The other runs the mail file a little less often, like every 5 minutes.

The mail file:
  1. Checks for new mail
  2. Filters any new mail into a nice string with the filter.scala script
  3. Saves them into the "mail-status" file.

The sb file:
  1. Checks the "mail-status" file for new mail info.
  2. Does some other system info calls to display a range of different things.
  3. Displays all the collected data in the dwm status bar.

The two files (sb/mail) are separated because we don't want to poll for mail
changes too often, but we DO want to update the status bar pretty often.
